Drug Treatment Study Analysis
All tumor volumes across all regimens averaged 40-54mm3.
Chosen 4 regimens for further analysis showed the lowest variance and errors in tumor volume:
Capomulin- Var: 25 , Std Err: 0.33
Ceftamin- Var: 39 , Std Err: 0.0.46
Infubinol- Var: 43 , Std Err: 0.49
Ramicane- Var: 23 , Std Err: 0.32
Study included roughly 50/50 distribution of mice sexes.
Capomulin and Ramicane top regimens with a sample of over 200 tested mice.
Capomulin and Ramicane showed lowest avg final tumor volumes.
One mouse sampled on Capomulin showed a 21% decrease in tumor volume over a 40 day period.
Capomulin showed a strong positive correlation of 0.84 showing a strong relationship between mice weights and avg tumor volumes.
On Capumulin treatment, avg tumor volume was directly proportional to weight of mice.
